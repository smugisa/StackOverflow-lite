                <h3>Apply materials to every other object in Unity using code <span class="highlight">by vanie mara</span></h3>
                <p>I'm trying to spawn 8 quads in a row and then assign a material to every other quad, so it would look like a checkerboard pattern. The code I have accomplishes that, but I was wondering if there was a way to simplify it. So if I were to create more quads in different positions (for example, I wanted to create a row above the one I've already created), I wouldn't have a long list of repetitive code.</p>

                <h3>How can i implement doPost() and doGet() request in the same servlet using ajax? <span class="highlight">by kmate</span></h3>
                <p>I am doing a small project on jsp servlet.I want an example to implement doGet() and doPost() methods using same servlet and sending and posting via an ajax call in forms in a jsp page.

                    Also specify why it is not recommendable to use doGet() and doPost() in the same servlet.How to implement the same using two different servlets but in the work in the same jsp page.

                <h3>Nuxt.js not accepting issue reports?<span class="highlight"> by smaje</span></h3>
                <p>There doesn't seem to be a way to file an issue for the Nuxt.js project or docs.

                    It seems to be a configuration issue on the cmty.app
                    
                    Is there any way to file an issue?</p>
